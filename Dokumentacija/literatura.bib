	abstract = {In the present work, the Monkey Algorithm was adapted to find the proper component configuration for a Hybrid Micro-Grid with the introduction of simulation techniques into the evaluation step of the heuristic in order to account for the stochastic behavior of the renewable energy components. The forecasting methods allow the simulation to solve the parameters required in the Monkey Algorithm evaluation step. The Renewable Energy Integration Problem is solved as a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem where the objectives take in account are the minimization of the total lifecycle cost of the system, involving the capital, replacement, operation, maintenance and the minimization of green house gas emissions. The Monkey Algorithm developed in this paper introduces a new methodology along the evaluation step of the heuristic based on meteorological factors, which allows the Hybrid Model to be simultaneously solved for both objectives.}

	abstract={In complexity theory, there is a widely studied grouping of optimization problems that belongs to the non-deterministic polynomial-time hard set. One of them is the set covering problem, known as one of Karp's 21 {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathscr {\{}NP{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}-complete problems, and it consists of finding a subset of decision variables for satisfying a set of constraints at the minimum feasible cost. However, due to the nature of the problem, this cannot be solved using traditional complete algorithms for hard instances. In this work, we present an improved binary version of the monkey search algorithm for solving the set covering problem. Originally, this approximate method was naturally inspired by the cognitive behavior of monkeys for climbing mountains. We propose a new climbing process with a better exploratory capability and a new cooperation procedure to reduce the number of unfeasible solutions. For testing this approach, we present a detailed computational results section, where we illustrate how this variation of the monkey search algorithm is capable of reaching various global optimums for a well-known instance set from the Beasley's OR-Library and how it outperforms many other heuristics and meta-heuristics addressed in the literature. Moreover, we add a complete statistical analysis to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to the original version.},

The tumors with distinguished boundaries are difficult to find in the MR brain images, while performing the manual segmentation process. There is a necessity of an automated segmentation technique for performing better segmentation in terms of tumors with distinguished boundaries. The automated modified monkey search technique is used to find the optimized cluster position, and a random search operation is performed is locate all the pixels present in the image and then finally the location of the tumor region is exactly segmented/predicted by using the suggested monkey search algorithm. The suggested technique will support the radiologist for finding the tumors with distinguishing boundaries and accuracy of prediction of tumors is also improved lot with this approach. Based on the early prediction of tumors, diagnosing procedures will save the lives of many human beings.}

This paper introduces and describes a solution to this famous problem using a new metaheuristic nature-inspired algorithm, called firefly algorithm, which was developed by Dr. Xin-She Yang at Cambridge University in 2007. A general formulation of this algorithm is presented together with an analytical mathematical modeling to solve this problem by a single equivalent objective function.

Firefly algorithm is a nature inspired algorithm based on the idealized behavior of the flash pattern and characteristics of fireflies. This study proposes a new improved firefly algorithm (IFA) based on Gaussian distribution function to the optimal chiller loading design. To testify the performance of the proposed method, the paper adopts two case studies comparing the results of the developed model using IFA with those of traditional firefly algorithm and other optimization methods in literature. In this paper, the optimization problem is minimize energy consumption of multi-chiller systems, where the objective function is energy consumption and the optimum parameter is the partial loading ratio of each chiller. The results of both case studies show that the proposed IFA outperform several optimization methods of the literature in terms of minimum energy consumption solution of the optimal chiller loading problem.}

In this paper, a new dynamic FA (called NDFA) is proposed for demand estimation of water resources in Nanchang city of China. First, a dynamic parameter strategy is used to avoid manually adjusting the step factor. Second, three estimation models in different forms (linear, exponential and hybrid) are developed in terms of the historical water use and local economic structure. Third, normalization method is utilized to eliminate the influences of different units of data. In the experiments, water use in Nanchang city from 2003 to 2015 is considered as a case study. The data from 2003 to 2012 are used for finding the optimal weights of the models, and the rest of data (2013–2015) are applied to test the models. Computational results show that all five FA variants can achieve promising solutions. The proposed NDFA obtains better performance than four other FA variants, and its prediction accuracy is up to 97.91%. Finally, the water demand in Nanchang city from 2017 to 2020 is predicted.}

The paper presents application and implementation of Firefly Algorithm (FA) for Mobile Robot Navigation (MRN) in uncertain environment. The uncertainty is defined over the changing environmental condition from static to dynamic. The attraction of one firefly towards the other firefly due to variation of their brightness is the key concept of the proposed study. The proposed controller efficiently explores the environment and improves the global search in less number of iterations and hence it can be easily implemented for real time obstacle avoidance especially for dynamic environment. It solves the challenges of navigation, minimizes the computational calculations, and avoids random moving of fireflies. The performance of proposed controller is better in terms of path optimality when compared to other intelligent navigational approaches.}
